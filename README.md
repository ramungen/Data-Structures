A c++ library of the following data structures:
1. set (based on avl tree)
2. map (based on avl tree)
3. queue (based on linked list)
4. stack (based on linked list)
5. hash_set (based on a hash table)
6. hash_map (based on a hash table)
7. slinked_list (singly linked list)
8. dlinked_list (doubly linked list)

The data structures are efficient and non-naive with full functionality.
